Inheritance Example:

//This is in the base.html file

<html>
  <head>
    <title>MY WEBSITE</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>


//This is in the index.html file

{% extends "base.html"  %}
 
{% block content %}
    <p>This is my paragraph for this page.</p>
{% endblock %}


Example exercises are in the base.html, index.html, and recipe.html file in the templates folder
